    bio: `My role basically involves keeping the society on track, so while all the committee are organising awesome events I have to make sure we are running smoothly and all the boring stuff gets done. I occasionally get to make executive decisions which is fun. I'm your first port of call for any queries or suggestions. If you have any ideas or something exciting that you want to be involved in then hit me up!`

    bio: `Apparently I'm now second in command, but I guess that's why they call me vice-president. My work in the society started in the second semester and despite only being a first year I am prepared to go above and beyond for you. If that means I occasionally give the other members of the committee a hard time then so be it. The most important thing to me, is you.`
